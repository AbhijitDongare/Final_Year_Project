Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a visual language used by the deaf community in 
India. The history of ISL is
intertwined with the history of deaf education in India. In the late 18th century, 
the first school for the deaf 
was established in India by a British missionary named Andrew Clarke.
The school was called the Bengal Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb and it was located 
in Kolkata (then Calcutta). 
At this school, Clarke developed a sign language system that was used to teach the 
students. Over time,
other schools for the deaf were established in different parts of India, each with 
their own sign language system.
In the early 20th century, the All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH) 
was established in Mysore. 
The AIISH played a significant
role in the development and standardization of Indian Sign Language. In 1967, the 
Indian government recognized ISL 
as the official sign language of the country. However, there is still a great deal 
of variation in the use of sign
language across different regions of India, and there is ongoing debate about 
whether there should be a national
standard for ISL. Today, ISL is used by millions of deaf people in India and is 
recognized as a rich and complex 
language with its own grammar and
syntax. There are also efforts underway to promote greater awareness of ISL among 
hearing people, as well as efforts 
to promote bilingualism among deaf children in India.
In January 1999, the Ramakrishna Mission embarked upon a very unique project in 
collaboration with CBM International,
Germany to standardize Indian Sign Language. November 24, 2001 became an important 
day for persons with hearing
impairment in India. In an august gathering, the first 'Indian Sign Language 
Dictionary' was released
The Indian Sign Language Dictionary was an earnest attempt based on years of 
research, documenting over 2500 signs 
from 42 cities in 12 States to provide a common sign language code all over India.
